Privacy Policy — SendMyFile

Last updated: [05.02.2026]

This Privacy Policy explains how personal data is processed when using SendMyFile (the “Application”). By using the Application, you agree to the practices described in this policy.

1) Scope and Definitions

Developer / Data Controller: [Name Surname / Company Name], [Address], [Country]
Contact: [support@…]
Purpose of the service: To enable users to transfer files between devices.

2) What Data Do We Collect / Process?

The Application may process the following data in order to function properly:

A) User-selected content
Names, sizes, and contents of files you send or receive.

B) Connection and technical data
Technical connection data such as IP address, network type (Wi-Fi / mobile), and connection quality (inherent to the nature of WebRTC).
Session/room information: Identifiers used for pairing, such as room codes / Room IDs.

C) Data stored on the device
Received files may be stored locally on your device under Downloads/SendMyFile (or Downloads only).

The Application does not automatically upload files to the developer.

Note: This policy is written on the assumption that no advertising or analytics tracking is used in the Application (e.g., ad SDKs or user profiling).

3) For What Purposes Do We Process Data?

To perform file transfers.

To establish connections between devices (pairing/signaling).

To diagnose network issues and improve the service (e.g., error reports/logs, if any).

4) Do Your Files Pass Through the Internet? (WebRTC / Signaling / TURN)

The Application typically uses the following architecture:

Signaling server (e.g., signal.xbetateta.org):
Used to exchange the necessary connection messages so devices can discover each other and establish a WebRTC connection.
File contents are normally not transmitted via the signaling server.

P2P (peer-to-peer) transfer (WebRTC DataChannel):
Under suitable network conditions, files can be transferred directly between devices.

TURN server (e.g., turn.xbetateta.org):
If a direct connection is not possible on certain networks, the connection may be relayed via a TURN server. In this case, file traffic may technically pass through the TURN server.
(This is sometimes unavoidable due to internet infrastructure constraints.)

5) With Whom Do We Share Data?

The Application shares your files with other users only within the scope of transfers you explicitly initiate.

If the signaling/TURN infrastructure is operated by you: no third-party data sharing occurs.

If the infrastructure is operated by third parties: connection-related data (such as IP address, timestamps, room codes) may be technically visible to or processed by these service providers.

The Application:

Does not sell your files.

Does not share data for marketing purposes.

6) Data Retention Period

Received files: Stored on your device; deletion is under your control.

Server logs (if any): May be retained for a limited period for security and debugging purposes (e.g., [7/14/30] days) and then deleted or anonymized.

7) Security

Encrypted communication (HTTPS/WSS/WebRTC encryption) is used where possible during data transfer.

However, no method of transmission over the internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. You are advised to take additional precautions for large or sensitive data.

8) Permissions

The Application may use the following permissions to operate:

INTERNET / Network access: For signaling and WebRTC connections.

File access / Saving to Downloads: Handled via system-provided methods depending on the Android version (e.g., MediaStore / system file picker).

The Application aims to avoid requesting unnecessary permissions.

9) Children’s Privacy

The Application is not intended for children under the age of 13. It does not knowingly collect data from children under 13.

10) Your Rights (KVKK / GDPR)

Depending on your country, you may have the following rights:

Access to your data

Correction or deletion of your data

Objection to or restriction of processing

Data portability (where applicable)

The right to lodge a complaint (e.g., with the Data Protection Authority)

For requests, you may contact: [support@…]

11) Changes

This policy may be updated from time to time. The current date is shown at the top of this page. Significant changes may be communicated via the Application or release notes.
